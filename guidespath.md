# Guides Path — The Missing Manual content roadmap

The master backlog of guides, organized by category and by learning track. This is the planning doc we
pick the next guide from — it is **not** an ingested guide (it lives at repo root, outside `guides/`).

Every shipped guide is a small phased series in our "battle-hardened friend" voice (see
`.claude/skills/missing-manual-writer/SKILL.md`). Source of truth is Markdown under `guides/<slug>/`;
content auto-syncs from that folder. Each `_guide.md` carries `category`, `difficulty`, and an `order:`
integer (position within its category).

**Two rules this roadmap is built around:**
1. **A→Z, every category.** Each category opens with a *"…From Zero"* rung (the absolute basics — what
   the thing *is*) and ladders **beginner → intermediate → advanced**, the way `version-control` does.
   No category may start mid-mountain (the old "databases starts at JOINs" mistake).
2. **Concept first, then the tool.** Teach the idea, then make it concrete with a tool guide that
   explains *what the tool is showing you* (not a click-by-click UI tour, which ages badly). Tool guides
   live in their concept category (Dynatrace → `performance`, Postman → `apis`, Wireshark → `networking`).

The 17 categories below match `content-core::categories::DEFS` (the canonical taxonomy) and appear in
that display order.

## Legend
- ✅ **done** — written and live
- 🔜 **next-priority** — strong candidate for the next build
- ⬜ **planned** — on the backlog
- ⭐ **feeds a learning-path track step** (lights up a "coming soon" step in the wizard — higher leverage)
- 🛠️ **tool guide** — concept-first, "what it's showing you"

## Learning-path tracks (from `content-core::tracks`)

Tracks string guides into a roadmap. **All six are wired and resolve to live guides** (the earlier
taxonomy sync + deferred fixes are done; choice options map to real per-language/api/deployment guides):

1. **Backend Developer** — version control → language (py/js/go/rust) → databases → API style
   (REST/GraphQL/gRPC) → deployment (Docker/K8s/VPS) → testing.
2. **DevOps Engineer** — version control → Linux for servers → containers & deployment → CI/CD →
   observability.
3. **Computer Foundations** — how a computer works → what an OS is → how the internet works → the
   terminal & shell.
4. **Observability & On-Call** — reading logs → logs/metrics/traces → dashboards (Prometheus/Grafana) →
   reading Dynatrace → when prod is down.
5. **Data Engineer** — what data engineering is → ETL/ELT → warehouses vs lakes → spreadsheets→SQL→pipelines
   → data quality & observability.
6. **Ship It** — a server → SSH → Docker → domain & DNS → HTTPS & a proxy → auto-deploy → the
   `ship-your-side-project` capstone.

*(Adding a track = a `TrackDef` in `content-core::tracks`; update the track tests' count. Choice
dimensions live in `dimension()`.)*

---

## Conventions reminder (for whoever writes the next one)
- Files: `guides/<slug>/_guide.md` (phase 0, carries `category`) + `NN-name.md` phases.
- Frontmatter on every file; `_guide.md` needs `category` + `order:` (its rung number in the table above) +
  `difficulty`. Keep the `order:` values matching this doc so the sidebar ladders A→Z.
- **Category** must be one of the 17 canonical slugs in `content-core::categories::DEFS`. Adding a category =
  one `DEFS` entry (it re-seeds on boot).
- Internal links: relative `.md` *within the same guide* (ingest rewrites them). **Cross-guide links must use
  the absolute web route** `/guides/<slug>` — the rewriter only handles same-guide prefix-less `.md` names.
- Tool guides: concept-first, explain *what the tool is showing you*, avoid click-by-click UI tours (they age).
- New content auto-syncs from `guides/` (files win on change); no rebuild needed for content, only for code.
