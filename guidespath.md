# Guides Path — The Missing Manual content roadmap

The master backlog of guides, organized by category and by learning track. This is the planning doc we
pick the next guide from — it is **not** an ingested guide (it lives at repo root, outside `guides/`).

Every shipped guide is a small phased series in our "battle-hardened friend" voice (see
`.claude/skills/missing-manual-writer/SKILL.md`). Source of truth is Markdown under `guides/<slug>/`;
content auto-syncs from that folder. Each `_guide.md` carries `category`, `difficulty`, and an `order:`
integer (position within its category).

**Two rules this roadmap is built around:**
1. **A→Z, every category.** Each category opens with a *"…From Zero"* rung (the absolute basics — what
   the thing *is*) and ladders **beginner → intermediate → advanced**, the way `version-control` does.
   No category may start mid-mountain (the old "databases starts at JOINs" mistake).
2. **Concept first, then the tool.** Teach the idea, then make it concrete with a tool guide that
   explains *what the tool is showing you* (not a click-by-click UI tour, which ages badly). Tool guides
   live in their concept category (Dynatrace → `performance`, Postman → `apis`, Wireshark → `networking`).

The 16 categories below match `content-core::categories::DEFS` (the canonical taxonomy) and appear in
that display order.

## Legend
- ✅ **done** — written and live
- 🔜 **next-priority** — strong candidate for the next build
- ⬜ **planned** — on the backlog
- ⭐ **feeds a learning-path track step** (lights up a "coming soon" step in the wizard — higher leverage)
- 🛠️ **tool guide** — concept-first, "what it's showing you"

## Learning-path tracks (from `content-core::tracks`)

Tracks string guides into a roadmap. The ⭐ items above are the steps currently showing "coming soon" —
filling them is the highest-leverage content because it completes a track the wizard already offers.

**Backend Developer:** version control ✅ → language ⭐ (`programming-languages`) → database ⭐ (`databases`)
→ API style ⭐ (`apis`) → deployment ⭐ (`infrastructure`) → testing ⭐ (`testing`)

**DevOps Engineer:** version control ✅ → containers & deployment ⭐ (`infrastructure`) → CI/CD ⭐ (`devops`)
→ observability ⭐ (`performance`)

### Proposed new tracks (once their categories have content)
- **Computer Foundations** (the "not only for developers" on-ramp): How a Computer Works (`hardware`) →
  What an OS Is (`operating-systems`) → How the Internet Works (`networking`) → The Terminal & Shell.
- **Observability & On-Call** (the monitoring/tool-reading path): Reading Logs (`debugging`) →
  Observability: Logs/Metrics/Traces (`performance`) → Reading Dynatrace / Graylog (`performance`) →
  When Prod Is Down (`debugging`).
- **Debugging / Troubleshooting:** stack traces → logs → reproducing → debugger → bisect → prod-down
  (the whole `debugging` ladder).

*(Adding a track = a `TrackDef` in `content-core::tracks`; choice options map to guide slugs once they exist.)*

---

## Conventions reminder (for whoever writes the next one)
- Files: `guides/<slug>/_guide.md` (phase 0, carries `category`) + `NN-name.md` phases.
- Frontmatter on every file; `_guide.md` needs `category` + `order:` (its rung number in the table above) +
  `difficulty`. Keep the `order:` values matching this doc so the sidebar ladders A→Z.
- **Category** must be one of the 16 canonical slugs in `content-core::categories::DEFS`. Adding a category =
  one `DEFS` entry (it re-seeds on boot).
- Internal links: relative `.md` *within the same guide* (ingest rewrites them). **Cross-guide links must use
  the absolute web route** `/guides/<slug>` — the rewriter only handles same-guide prefix-less `.md` names.
- Tool guides: concept-first, explain *what the tool is showing you*, avoid click-by-click UI tours (they age).
- New content auto-syncs from `guides/` (files win on change); no rebuild needed for content, only for code.
